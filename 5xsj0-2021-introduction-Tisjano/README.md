Welcome to you first assignment. This is an ungraded assignment and it should help you to familiarize yourself with Git, GitHub, and Jupyter Notebooks (Python develepment and execution environment).

First, please read [Basics of GitHub](BasicsOfGitHub.md) and understand how it works.

Then, after you succesfully installed [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution and [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) library, you can run and implement a power function in [Introdution](Introduction.ipynb) python notebook. You shall not modify or delete any other files in the repository.

Last, submit your assignment by commiting and pushing your changed notebook file (Introduction.ipynb).

You should see the autograder to test your solution under GitHub Actions of your repository.

Wish you a lot of success!
